## Vagrant for Laravel 4

### Very fast and easy way to get vagrant up and running

### Installation

Place both the ````Vagrantfile```` and ````bootstrap.sh```` in the root of your laravel project, then just run ````vagrant up```` and everything should be up and running. When you are done, run ````vagrant halt````, ````vagrant suspend```` or ````vagrant destory```` according to your needs.

Tested on ````Vagrant 1.2.2````.
